= WSL2 and Windows Terminal Setup Guide on Windows 10

== 1. Ensure Windows 10 Version Compatibility
WSL2 requires Windows 10, version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher. To check your version of Windows:

- Press `Win + R` and type `winver`, then press Enter.
- If your version is lower than 1903, you'll need to update Windows before proceeding.

== 2. Enable WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
You must enable the WSL feature in Windows. Here's how:

- Open **PowerShell** as Administrator:
  - Right-click on the Start Menu and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
- Run the following command to enable the WSL feature:

[source,bash]
----
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
----

== 3. Enable Virtual Machine Platform
WSL2 requires the Virtual Machine Platform feature. Run the following command in PowerShell (still as Admin):

[source,bash]
----
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
----

After running this command, **restart your PC**.

== 4. Set WSL2 as the Default Version
Once your PC has restarted, open PowerShell again and set WSL2 as the default version using the command:

[source,bash]
----
wsl --set-default-version 2
----

== 5. Manually Trigger a WSL Kernel Update
To ensure your WSL kernel is up to date, you can manually check for updates and install the latest kernel. Run the following command in PowerShell:

[source,bash]
----
wsl --update
----

This will update your WSL installation to the latest version and ensure the most recent kernel is installed.

You can verify the current version with:

[source,bash]
----
wsl --version
----

== 6. Install a Linux Distribution
To see a list of available Linux distributions:

[source,bash]
----
wsl --list --online
----

This will display a list of distributions that can be installed.

To install **Debian**, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
wsl --install -d Debian
----

This command will download, install and launch Debian.

Once the installation is complete, Debian is launched. You'll be prompted to create a UNIX username and password.

== 7. Install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store
Windows Terminal provides a modern interface for using WSL. To install it:

- Open the **Microsoft Store**.
- Search for **Windows Terminal**.
- Click **Get** or **Install**.

Once installed, you can open **Windows Terminal** from the Start Menu.

== 8. Configure Windows Terminal to Use WSL2
By default, Windows Terminal may open PowerShell. You can configure it to open WSL by default:

- Open **Windows Terminal**.
- Click on the **down arrow** next to the tab bar, then select **Settings**.
- Under **Profiles** on the left-hand menu, select your Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Scroll down and ensure it is set to use **WSL2**.
- If you want WSL2 to be the default profile, scroll to the **Startup** tab and set your Linux profile (e.g., Ubuntu) as the default profile.

Now, each time you open Windows Terminal, it will open your Linux environment in WSL2.

== 9. Enabling systemd Support in WSL

Many Linux distributions, including **Debian**, use `systemd` as their default system and service manager. WSL has support for `systemd`, but it's not enabled by default. To enable `systemd` in WSL, follow these steps:

=== Open the WSL Terminal and Edit the Configuration File

In your WSL terminal (Debian or any other distribution), you need to edit the `wsl.conf` file to enable `systemd`. This requires root privileges, so use the `sudo` command to run the `nano` editor with elevated permissions:

[source,bash]
----
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
----

=== Modify the wsl.conf File to Enable systemd

Once the file is open in the `nano` editor, add the following lines (or modify them if they already exist) under the `[boot]` section:

[source]
----
[boot]
systemd=true
----

This configuration enables `systemd` to start when the WSL environment is booted.

=== Save the Changes and Exit nano

To save the changes in `nano`, follow these steps:
- Press `Ctrl + O` to write the changes (you'll be asked to confirm the file name, press `Enter`).
- Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

=== Restart WSL

After modifying the configuration file, you'll need to restart WSL for the changes to take effect. Run the following command from your Windows **PowerShell** (not inside WSL) to restart the WSL service:

[source,bash]
----
wsl --shutdown
----

After running this command, relaunch your WSL distribution by typing `wsl` or launching it from the Start Menu.

=== Verify systemd is Running

Once WSL is restarted, you can verify that `systemd` is running by checking the status of a known `systemd` service. For example, check the status of the **cron** service:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl status cron
----

If `systemd` is enabled successfully, you will see the service status and `systemd`-specific output.
